This folder contains training, validation and test data Fast-ABC paper experiments. 
They concern the Ground Penetrating Radar tomography from geophysics. 

- Subsurface slowness fields (ns/m) (a.k.a. models) were simulated from a multivariate Gaussian with the following configuration : 
 * Subsurface image size : 40 x 50 pixels (width x height) -> scale of 0.1 meters -> subsurface model of 4 x 5 meters
 * Mean = 14 
 * Covariance kernel : isotropic exponential, with 25 pixels of length scales in each direction and variance = 0.16 
 
- First arrival times vectors : 
 * 9 emitters and 9 receivers are assumed to be placed on the sides of subsurface models. Check paper detailed for setup. 
 * to each model from above we apply the straight ray forward solver (i.e., linear solver) to get a vector of 81 measurment values (a.k.a. truett).
    A code example for the solver can be found here : https://github.com/jlalvis/VAE_SGD/blob/master/SGAN/tomokernel_straight.py 
 

The files are in H5 format. They can be read using the package h5py. The numbers in the training file names indicate the size of training set. 

To read files : 

# training models and truett 
train_models_file = h5py.File('./Data/train_models.h5')
train_truett_file = h5py.File('./Data/train_truett_lin_81.h5')

train_models_all = torch.FloatTensor(train_models_file.get("train_models"))
train_truett_lin_all = torch.FloatTensor(train_truett_file.get("train_truett_lin_81"))

# test models and truett
test_models_file = h5py.File('./Data/test_models.h5')
test_truett_file = h5py.File('./Data/test_truett_lin_81.h5')

test_models = torch.FloatTensor(test_models_file.get("test_models"))
test_truett_lin = torch.FloatTensor(test_truett_file.get('test_truett_lin_81'))

# validation models and truett
val_models_file = h5py.File('./Data/val2_models.h5') # or val1_models.h5
val_truett_file = h5py.File('./Data/val2_truett_lin_81.h5')

val_models = torch.FloatTensor(val_models_file.get("val_models"))
val_truett = torch.FloatTensor(val_truett_file.get('val_truett_lin_81'))
